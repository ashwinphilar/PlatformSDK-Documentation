# Platform SDK Documentation


## Introduction

In order to align the documentation with the development process for creating the Platform SDK, I've seeded the initial documentation files on a GitHub repository. Since markdown is the preferred format for documents on GitHub, I'm following that convention as well.

The intent of this initial round of documentation is to lay out how GitHub can be leveraged while building out the Platform SDK. Once we have all had a chance to review the documents and structure of the organization and repositories, we can finalize the documentation so that developers contributing to the projects have an initial launch point to understand how the development process works.

_In the near future, I'd be happy to demonstrate how organizations within RelayHealth are using Git to manage source for production applications. This will include general Git usage, repository organization, daily development cadence, and branch management._
